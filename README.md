## About the Project ##
Handle your to-do list with **Get It Done!** Add, delete, and modify tasks with ease. Set them custom, coloured labels for better identification. Pick the dates and priorities to sort and prioritize the tasks. **Get It Done!** with its simple and intuitive interface will help you stay productive and manage your time better.

## Technologies ##

* **React** 18.2.0

## Motivation ##
By creating this project I wanted to learn and practice:
* **React Hooks** - useState, useEffect
* **State management** - I dug into Redux, but finally decided that for this size of project useContext will be a better solution.
* **React Bootstrap** components
* Saving data in **session storage** 
* Exercise **handling events**
* Recreating visual prototype which I've built in **Figma**

## Inspiration ##
While the project is my own, I drew upon <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@developedbyed'>Developedbyed</a> tutorials to guide my approach and learn new techniques.
