## About the Project ##
Handle your to-do list with **Get It Done!** Add, delete, and modify tasks with ease. Set them custom, coloured labels for better identification. Pick the dates and priorities to sort and prioritize the tasks. Our app with its simple and intuitive interface will help you stay productive and manage your time better!

## Technologies ##

* **React** 18.2.0

## Purpose of making this project ##
By making this project I wanted to learn and practice:
* **React Hooks** - useState, useEffect
* **State management** - I dug into Redux, but finally decided that for this size of project useContext will be a better solution.
* **React Bootstrap** components
* Excercise **handling events**
* Recreating prototype which I've built in **Figma**
